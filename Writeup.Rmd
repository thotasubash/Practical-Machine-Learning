Data

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.

train_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/Thota/Downloads/pml-training.csv", na.strings=c("", "NA"))
test_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/Thota/Downloads/pml-testing.csv", na.strings=c("", "NA"))

The first column of the data is just index. We remove it from training data frame.

train_data$X <- NULL
Similarly the user and time information should not have any effect on whether barbell lifts are performed correctly or not.

cols_to_remove <- c("user_name", "raw_timestamp_part_1",
"raw_timestamp_part_2", "cvtd_timestamp")
for (col in cols_to_remove) {
    train_data[, col] <- NULL
}
Many columns in the dataset have mostly missing values. We remove features from the training and testing data that have too many missing values, where imputing is not an option.

NAs <- apply(train_data,2,function(x) {sum(is.na(x))})
train_data <- train_data[,which(NAs == 0)]

We also remove features that don't have many missing values but have one unique value (i.e. zero variance predictors) 
or have few unique values relative to the number of samples and the ratio of frequency of the most common value 
to the frequency of second most common value is large.

nsv <- nearZeroVar(train_data)
train_data <- train_data[-nsv]
test_data <- test_data[-nsv]

The model

We build a random forest classifier to predict the action class. To measure the accuracy of the model, 
we do 10-fold cross validation with 80:20 split, on each fold, 80% of the data is used for training the 
random forest and remaining 20% is used for testing.

library(randomForest)
set.seed(1)
obs <- c()
preds <- c()
for(i in 1:10) {
    intrain = sample(1:dim(train_data)[1], size=dim(train_data)[1] * 0.8, replace=F)
    train_cross = train_data[intrain,]
    test_cross = train_data[-intrain,]
    rf <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data=train_cross)
    obs <- c(obs, test_cross$classe)
    preds <- c(preds, predict(rf, test_cross))
}
The confusion matrix for predictions on cross validation folds is given below.

conf_mat <- confusionMatrix(table(preds, obs))
conf_mat$table
The proposed model seems classifying well enough. The accuracy is r conf_mat$overall[[1]] * 100% and it misclassified 
only few instances. Finally, we train the random forest with whole dataset so that the classifier can be used to 
predict the class of an action, given the set of activity measurements.

model <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data=train_data)
